<h1>Docker</h1>
<h2>what is docker</h2>
<p>Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers</p>

<hr>
<h5>problem statement: why do we need docker</h5>
<p>For example when we built an application using react js, nodejs, mongodb, express and many more packages in one system. If i want to run the same application into the another system then problem arises. We can not run the project into the other system directly because of the versions problem. Therefore, docker has a concept of containerization where we create container and we can add projects into that container. </p>
